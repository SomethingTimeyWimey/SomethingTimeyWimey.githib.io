    <li>Arduino sensors connected to the breadboard while we wait for the smaller custom Printed Circuit Board that will go on top of the XBee shield,

	Progress is proceeding slightly behind schedule due to parts delivery issues but is expected to catch up by next week. Budget is still on track.</li>
