   <ul>
    <li>Arduino sensors connected to the breadboard while we wait for the smaller custom Printed Circuit Board that will go on top of the XBee shield, 
	and the casing in which our arduino and all the sensors will be. PCB and Casing fabrication is expected to be done by Friday, November 11, 2016.
	Progress is proceeding slightly behind schedule due to parts delivery issues but is expected to catch up by next week. Budget is still on track.</li>

   <ul>
    <li>Recently printed and soldered curcuit board Sensor Hat which was tested for shorts. Continuing to gather arduino, XBee shields, XBee transmitters,
	and a variety of sensors to be used on the final prototype. Progress proceeds according to schedule defined in proposal. No problems encountered
	at this point in the process and the budget is still on track.</li>
